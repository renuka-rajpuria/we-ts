## FAQs and Issues

### 1.1 FAQs

#### Cannot Approach Problem

- I get sad when I am trying for a long time but can't solve the question.

  > What matrix to record while solving questions?
  > - Number of approaches tried - different data structures
  > - Number of questions attempted
  > - New things learnt

- I don't remember the approach I solved before.

  > - Refer to the last point above.
  > - Appreciate and question the approach.
  > - Look at the applications of the approach.

- Cannot solve hard problems but can do easy and medium level problems.
  - Cannot think of mathematical approaches.
    
  > Have better mathematical tools.
  
  - Cannot solve for question in optimised approach.
  - Cannot think of the best approach right away.
    
  > Find enough approaches.
  > Comparison is the easy part
  
  - Cannot solve for all the test cases.
  - Cannot think of all corner cases.
 
  > Better mathematical tools such as invariant.
  
- I get annoyed when the solution turns out to be very simple.
- I don't know when to see the solution.
    - I don't know if I have tried everything
  
  > - When you cannot think of a new approach to try.
  > - Accept or discard approaches quickly.
 
#### Topic Problems

- Cannot solve Graphs, Trees and DP questions.
  > Focus on recursion
  > Try [interview bit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) platform. 

- Cannot explain explain the abstractions involved.
  - I cannot see the big picture approach
    
  > Need to analyse the approaches on paper
  
- Cannot code up the problem even after knowing the approach.
  - I am able to see the rough approach but I miss the details.
  - I am able to think of an approach but cannot explain it to the interviewer.
    
  > - If you can clearly state the approach, then you can code it up.
  > - You should be able to answer the questions about it
  > - Functional decomposition

- I don't know how to improve the code.
  
  > Give a critical look to the code - like a code review


#### Time Management

- How much time to give each topic?
    > Practice on Interview Bit
- I cannot be consistent with my practice.
- I sit down to code but I don't feel like it.
- I don't know how much time to spend on coding everyday.
